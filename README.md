* To learn more about question answering have a look at [21 - 1 - What is Question Answering-NLP-Dan Jurafsky & Chris Manning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAHZPL6voc4).
* [START](http://start.csail.mit.edu/index.php) is another question answering system developed by the [MIT InfoLab](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/index.html). How the system works is superficially explained [here](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/projects.html).
* [yodaqa](https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa) is a further question answering system developed in python which is unfortunately currently not working since the necessary services provided by the auther are not reachable at the moment (see [issue #73](https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa/issues/73)).
